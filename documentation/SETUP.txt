INITIAL BITNAMI EC2 INSTANCE SETUP!

----------------
INTRO
----------------

Heeeeyo! This is how I managed to setup my instance to display something like
this: http://ec2-54-242-163-11.compute-1.amazonaws.com/Project. Basically, what's here is 
the django application serving up the basic HTML template as well as the css/javascript/images
with it.

Let me know if you need any help. 

----------------
TUTORIAL THINGY
----------------

1. SSH into your EC2 BitNami instance.

2. Navigate to apps/django directory.

3. Remove django_projects folder. 

4. Clone git repo into new django_projects folder. I used this command:
git clone git://github.com/umwood89/4350-group-awesome-repo.git django_projects
(you may need to 'apt-get install git' to install the git commands)

NOTE: This makes clones our git repo into the django_projects folder. So, our documentation 
will reside in here as well.

5. In the same level as the django_project folder, navigate to the "conf" folder.

6. Edit the django.conf file. This file configures the server to serve up our static content.
Directly underneath the "Alias /static" line, add the following lines:

Alias /css "/home/bitnami/apps/django/django_projects/Project/Project/static/css"
Alias /img "/home/bitnami/apps/django/django_projects/Project/Project/static/img"
Alias /js "/home/bitnami/apps/django/django_projects/Project/Project/static/js"

And at the very bottom of the file, add this stuff:

<Directory '/home/bitnami/apps/django/django_projects/Project/Project/static/'>
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

7. Done?

----------------
OUTCOME
----------------

From here, you should be able to access the site using http://your_ec2_instance_public_dns.com/Project.

MORE STUFF
----------------

You probably want to setup the "thisforthat" database on your EC2 instance. To do that..

1. Enter this command: mysql -u root -p
2. It'll as for a password, should be 'bitnami'.
3. You should be in the mysql prompt screen.
4. Enter this command: CREATE DATABASE thisforthat; (don't forget the semicolon)

That'll create the database with the name 'thisforthat'. 
After creating the DB, you should be able to use the 'python manage.py syncdb' command to
configure your db according to the models.py in TFT.
